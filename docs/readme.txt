README FIRST
-----------------------


The Spotlight module can be used to 'spot' an article of special interest on your mainpage. It still is
a block but as a central block it has the most value [even if Spotlight can be used as any normal block]

PLEASE NOTE: You MUST chmod the 'thumbs' folder within the 'images' folder for thumbs to work correctly. If for some
reason Thumbnail images do not work on your server, you can turn 'off' this option in the module configuration.
