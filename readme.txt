and Catzwolf (catzwolf@wfsections.xoops2.com)

--------------------------------------------------------------
Dopo l'installazione del modulo vanno modificate le impostazioni del blocco "Spotlight - News"
la disposizione consigliata è "Blocco centrale centro".
Si ricorda inoltre di verificare e settare i permessi di accesso al modulo.

Per informazioni, help, suggerimenti : spark@kuht.it
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Spotlight module can be used to 'spot' an article of special interest on your mainpage. It still is
a block but as a central block it has the most value [even if Spotlight can be used as any normal block]
The information in Italian is still there, in respect to the original author of Spotlight but for help,
information and suggestions, please visit http://wfsections.xoops2.com

PLEASE NOTE: You MUST chmod the 'thumbs' folder within the 'images' folder for thumbs to work correctly. If for some 
reason Thumbnail images do not work on your server, you can turn 'off' this option in the module configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------
:: This is also the version which shows only newsitems.
